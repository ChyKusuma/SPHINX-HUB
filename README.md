## Introduction

Welcome to our inclusive and dynamic decentralized world, where individuals and institutional from all walks of life are warmly invited to join and support the mission. Here, we believe that everyone has unique skills and passions to offer, and we encourage you to commit your talents towards making a lasting impact in the decentralized realm.

This project is dedicated to the world community as an Open-source Post-quantum blockchain layer 1 project, means anyone can join and contribute based on his/ her passion and skills. SPHINX is a blockchain protocol designed to provide secure and scalable solutions in the post-quantum era.

Together, we form a united front dedicated to creating the most sustainable and robust blockchain ecosystem. Our goal is not only to strengthen the existing web3 ecosystem but also to anticipate and navigate the disruptive challenges posed by the imminent arrival of quantum computers.

In this era of quantum-computers, we envision a future that is brighter and more promising for the global community. By synergizing our efforts, knowledge, and expertise, we strive to shape an innovative landscape that transcends boundaries and unlocks boundless possibilities.


## Background

In a world where technology is constantly advancing, it is crucial for us to recognize the pressing need to transition into the post-quantum era. The advent of quantum computers, with their unparalleled computational power and the ability to solve complex problems at an unprecedented scale, has the potential to revolutionize industries and disrupt existing cryptographic systems.

Traditional cryptographic algorithms, which have served us well in securing sensitive information and facilitating secure transactions, face a formidable challenge in the face of quantum computers. These advanced machines possess the capability to break conventional cryptographic methods, rendering them vulnerable to attacks that were previously inconceivable. The very foundations upon which our digital infrastructure rests are at risk, necessitating a proactive and strategic shift towards post-quantum cryptography.

By embracing the post-quantum era, we acknowledge the imperative to fortify our digital systems against the threats posed by quantum computing. It is a call to action, urging us to develop and implement quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms that can withstand the computational might of these emerging technologies. Such algorithms, based on novel mathematical principles and cryptographic primitives, are designed to offer robust security even in the face of quantum adversaries.

Entering the post-quantum era is not merely a matter of security; it is an opportunity to redefine the future landscape of technology and safeguard the integrity of our digital interactions. By proactively embracing this transition, we pave the way for a more resilient and trustworthy digital infrastructure. We empower individuals and organizations to continue operating securely, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring the privacy of online communications.

Furthermore, the post-quantum era presents us with the prospect of fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It opens up avenues for groundbreaking research, collaboration, and the development of new cryptographic techniques that transcend the limitations of classical computing. By investing in this transformative shift, we position ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements, driving progress and staying ahead in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

In conclusion, the urgency to enter the post-quantum era arises from the potential threats posed by quantum computers to our existing cryptographic systems. By embracing this transition, we fortify our digital infrastructure, protect sensitive information, and lay the foundation for a future where security, innovation, and progress coexist harmoniously. Together, let us seize this opportunity to shape a robust and secure post-quantum era, where technology empowers and safeguards us in equal measure.
